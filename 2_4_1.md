# Exercise 1 #

1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.

A flexible method requires a large sample size if it needs be as good or better than inflexible method. Hence, give that p << n, the flexible statistical learning method would be better than inflexible method.

(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.

In such a situation the inflexible method will be much better. Again the reason for flexible method to do poorly is due to lack of large n.

(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.

The inflexible method has low variance and high bias associated with it. Given that the relationship is non-linear, fitting an inflexible method will have poor fit than a flexible method. Hence, flexible method would be better.

(d) The variance of the error terms i.e. sigma^2 = Var(epsilon) is extremely high.

If the variance is high then it suggests that the inflexible method is a better fit. The variance is high for flexible method when it begins to overfit the data.
