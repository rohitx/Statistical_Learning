2.4.9: This exercise involves the Auto data set studied in the lab. Make sure that the missing values have been removed from the data

**Answer:**
First we will clean the data. The column horsepower has '?'.
```r
> idx <- auto == '?'
> is.na(auto) <- idx
> auto_clean = auto[complete.cases(auto),]
# Some of the values in horsepower are not numeric. So we change that:
> auto_clean[, 4] <- as.numeric(as.character(auto_clean[, 4] ))
```

1. Which of the predictors are quantitative, and which are qualitative?
2. What is the range of each quantitative predictor?
3. What is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative predictor?
4. Now remove the 10th through 85th observations. What is the range, mean, and standard deviation of each predictor in the subset of the data that remains?
5. Using the full data set, investigate the predictors graphically, using scatterplots or other tools of your choice. Create some plots highlighting the relationships among the predictors. Comment on your findings.
6. Suppose that we wish to predict gas milage (mpg) on the basis of the other variables. Do your plots suggest that any of the other variables might be useful in predicting mpg? Justify your answer.

**Answers**
1.The quantitative predictors are: mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and year. The qualitative predictors are: origin and name.
2. The range of the quantitative predictors are the following:
```r
> sapply(auto_clean[, 1:7], range)
      mpg cylinders displacement horsepower weight acceleration year
[1,]  9.0         3           68         46   1613          8.0   70
[2,] 46.6         8          455        230   5140         24.8   82
```
3. The mean and the variance is as follows:
```r
> sapply(auto_clean[, 1:7], mean)
         mpg    cylinders displacement   horsepower       weight acceleration 
   23.445918     5.471939   194.411990   104.469388  2977.584184    15.541327 
        year 
   75.979592

   > sapply(auto_clean[, 1:7], sd)
         mpg    cylinders displacement   horsepower       weight acceleration 
    7.805007     1.705783   104.644004    38.491160   849.402560     2.758864 
        year 
    3.683737
```
4. In this case, we need to remove 10th to 85th as follows:
```r
newAuto = auto_clean[-(10:85),]
dim(newAuto)
dim(auto_clean)

> sapply(newAuto[,1:7], range)
      mpg cylinders displacement horsepower weight acceleration year
[1,] 11.0         3           68         46   1649          8.5   70
[2,] 46.6         8          455        230   4997         24.8   82

> sapply(newAuto[,1:7], mean)
         mpg    cylinders displacement   horsepower       weight acceleration
   24.404430     5.373418   187.240506   100.721519  2935.971519    15.726899
        year
   77.145570
> sapply(newAuto[,1:7], sd)
         mpg    cylinders displacement   horsepower       weight acceleration
    7.867283     1.654179    99.678367    35.708853   811.300208     2.693721
        year 
    3.106217
```

5. The pairs() function allows us to look at the relationship between all predictors. We do the following:
```r
>pairs(auto_clean[,1:7])
```
Looking at the plots, I find that there is a non-linear decreasing relationship between mgp and displacement, horsepower, and weight. There seems to be no relationship between mpg and acceleration. There is a increasing linear relationship between mpg and year though it looks rather weak.
The relationships between displacement and horsepower, and weight is increasing linear. A similar relationship is seen between horsepower and weight.
Horsepower and acceleration shows a non-linear trend while displacement and acceleration shows a weak linear trend.
6. Cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight are strongly correlated with mpg so they will definitely help. Year is weakly correlated so that would not add much while acceleration shows no correlation so that can be left out. The same goes with names.
