2.4.4: You will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning.
(a) Describe three real-life applications in which classification might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is this goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.

**Answer:**

(b) Describe three real-life applications in which regression might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or predictions? Explain your answer.

1. Sucess or failure of a movie. This is a classification problem where we determine whether a movie will be successful or not. The response function in this case is categorical: success or failure. The predictors would be directors, actors, budget, producers, movie support, cameramen, makeup artists, etc.
2. Book Recommendations. This is a classic classification problem. The response function would be a categorical variable: recommend or recommend not. The predictors would be book genre, author, publisher, number of pages, date of publication, etc.

1. Housing Prices. This is a regression problem where the predictors could be area of the house, number of rooms, neighborhood, and the response function would be the house prices.
2. Airline Ticket: When is the best time to buy an airline ticket. The predictors would be time of day, time of week, destination, length of flights, number of connections, flight companies, etc.
