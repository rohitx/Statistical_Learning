2.4.1: For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer

(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.
(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.
(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear
(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. sigma^2 = Var(epsilon), is extremely high.

###Answers:###
The general properties of flexible statistical learning methods indicate that they work best when: (1) n is large, (2) p << n, and (3) make no assumption of the relationship between predictors and response.

(a) Following the above the flexible statistical learning will work better than inflexible learning method
(b) Following the above, the flexible statistical learning will work worse than inflexible learning method
(c) Following the above the flexible statistical learning will work better than inflexible learning method as the latter makes an assumption.
(d) Inflexible methods have low variance and high bias while the inflexible methods have high variance and low bias. Hence, the inflexible method will work best.
