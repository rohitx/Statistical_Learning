2.4.2: Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide n and p.

(a) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.

**Answer:**There are 3 predictors in the dataset. They are: record profit, number of employees, and industry salary. n = 500 because each of the predictors will have 500 values associated with them. The response function is CEO salary. This is a regression problem in which we find out which predictors affect the response function, CEO salary.

(b) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product, we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.

**Answer:** In this case, n = 20 and p = 13. This is a classification problem.

(c) In this case, n = 52 as there are 52 weeks in 2012. There are 4 predictors. I would use regression.
