You will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning.

Describe three real-life applications in which classification might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.

1. Does the patient has cancer or not? The predictors are various test such as blood, marrow, genetics and the response is either yes or no. This is prediction.
2. Will the customer commit fraud? Here the predictors are bank accounts, recent transaction, account history. This is again a prediction.
3. Classifying good and bad reviews for a given products.

Describe three real-life applications in which regression might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.

1. Understanding relationship between number of reviews and review rating. This is more likely to be a linear regression type relation.
2.
