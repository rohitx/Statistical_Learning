Problem #9: This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the Auto data set.

(a) Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the data set.
**Answer:** This is accomplished by the pairs() function in R
```r
Auto = read.csv('Auto.csv', header=TRUE)
pairs(Auto)
```
The result is the following:

(b) Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function cor(). You will need to exclude the name variable, which is qualitative.
**Answer:** First we need to clean 'horsepower' as it has few NaNs then we remove the name variable and finally we compute the correlation matrix.
```r
Auto = Auto[complete.cases(Auto),]
auto_clean = Auto[1:8]

cor(auto_clean)

(c) Use the lm() function to perform a multiple linear regression with mpg as the response and all other variables except name as the predictors. Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output. For instance:

(i) Is there a relationship between predictors and the response?
**Answer:** I have the following:
```r
> lm.fit = lm(mpg~., data=auto_clean)
> summary(lm.fit)

Call:
lm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = auto_clean)

Looking at the data we find that *cylinders*, *horsepower*, and *acceleration* have no correlation with *mpg*. Other than that all other predictors have a relationship with the response.

(ii) Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
**Answer:** Displacement, Weight, year, and origin have statistically significant relationship with the response.

(iii) What does the coefficient for the year variable suggest?
Given that the coefficient of the year is close to zero but not zero suggests that the value is very significant. Furthermore, the positive coefficient suggests that the cars become more fuel efficient with increasing year.
