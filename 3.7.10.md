3.7.10 This question should be answered using the Carseats data set.

(a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price, Urban, and US.

**Answer:** This is done in the following way:
```r
> library(ISLR)
> lm.fit = lm(Sales~Price+Urban+US)

> summary(lm.fit)

Call:
lm(formula = Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-6.9206 -1.6220 -0.0564  1.5786  7.0581 

Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) 13.043469   0.651012  20.036  < 2e-16 ***
Price       -0.054459   0.005242 -10.389  < 2e-16 ***
UrbanYes    -0.021916   0.271650  -0.081    0.936    
USYes        1.200573   0.259042   4.635 4.86e-06 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 2.472 on 396 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.2393,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.2335 
F-statistic: 41.52 on 3 and 396 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

(b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful --some of the variables in the model are qualitative!

**Answer:** Urban and US are qualitative. We find that Price and USYes is significant but UrbanYes is not. That is, Price and USYes have a relationship with Sales but not Urban. To understand more what these predictors mean, we do: ?Carseats in R. We find that:

* ‘Price’ Price company charges for car seats at each site
* ‘Urban’ A factor with levels ‘No’ and ‘Yes’ to indicate whether the store is in an urban or rural location
* ‘US’ A factor with levels ‘No’ and ‘Yes’ to indicate whether the store is in the US or not

So we find that the sales of carseats are not affected by whether a store is in urban or rural location but affected by the fact that it is in the US. The positive coefficient of the USYes predictors suggest that the sales are more if the store is in the U.S.

(c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.

Sales = -0.05 * Price -0.02 * UrbanYes + 1.20 * USYes

(d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis?

**Answer:**For price and USYes we can reject the null hypothesis.

(e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

**Answer:**
```r
> lm.fit = lm(Sales~Price+US, data=Carseats)
> summary(lm.fit)

Call:
lm(formula = Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-6.9269 -1.6286 -0.0574  1.5766  7.0515 

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) 13.03079    0.63098  20.652  < 2e-16 ***
Price       -0.05448    0.00523 -10.416  < 2e-16 ***
USYes        1.19964    0.25846   4.641 4.71e-06 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 2.469 on 397 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.2393,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.2354
F-statistic: 62.43 on 2 and 397 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

(f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

The F-statistic in (a) is 41.52 and RSE = 2.472 in (e) F = 62.43 and RSE=2.469. This suggests a much better fit to the data.

(g) Using the model from (e), obtain a 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients.

**Answer:**
```r
> confint(lm.fit)
                  2.5 %      97.5 %
(Intercept) 11.79032020 14.27126531
Price       -0.06475984 -0.04419543
USYes        0.69151957  1.70776632
```

(h) Is there evidence of outliers or high leverage observations in the model from (e)?

**Answer:**
```r
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(predict(lm.fit), rstudent(lm.fit))
```
We find that all of the data is bound between -3 and 3 indicative of that there is no outliers.

```r
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit)
```
Looking at the Residuals vs leverage, we find that we have a one high leverage point which may cause problem. This is because the point with a value of 0.0076 greatly exceeds (p+1)/n. The Residual vs fitted is very flat indicating that we have a good fit to the data.
